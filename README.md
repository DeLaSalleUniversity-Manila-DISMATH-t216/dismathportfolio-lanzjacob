#WEEK 1

####Orientation Day
* I was introduced to our subject Discrete Mathematics (DISMATH).
* My mind was tested through the Knights and Knaves exercise we had on our first day.
* Through that exercise, I was able to have a glimpse on what DISMATH is all about.

### Proof
* I learned all about proof, proposition, logical deduction and axiom.

### Truth
* I learned about the different kinds of truth which are:
  * Legal Truth
  * Authorative Truth
  * Scientific Truth
  * Probable Truth
  * Philosophical Truth

### Logical Connectives
* I was introduced to the following Logical Connectives:
  * Negation
  * Conjunction 
  * Disjunction
  * Exclusive or
  * Conditional
  * Biconditional
* I also learned about the truth tables of the different logical connectives
  * A truth table is a tool that can be used in order to know the corresponding output from all the possible combinations of the input.
  
####Logical Equivalences
* I learned about the different logical equivalences that can be used in proving.
  * Identity Laws
  * Domination Laws
  * Negation Laws
  * Double Negation Laws
  * Idempotent Law
  * Commutative Laws
  * Associative Laws
  * Distributive Laws
  * De Morgan's Laws
  * Absorption Laws

####Weekly Reflection
* At first, I thought that I will have a hard time in this subject because I didn't fully understand the topics. But after our professor explained everything, I was relieved because some of the topics were really easy.
* For me, logical equivalences is so far the easiest topic in this subject.

#WEEK 2

####Predicate Logic
* I learned that a Predicate Logic is not only concerned with logical relations between sentences or propositions as a whole, but also with their internal structure in terms of subject and predicate.

####Quantifiers
* I was introduced to the concept of quantifiers.
* I also learned about two kinds of quantifiers which are:
  * Universal Quantifier - a property is true for all values
  * Existential Quantifier - a property is true for at least one value in the domain

####Rules of Inference
* I was introduced to the important terminologies used in studying rules of inference
  * Argument
  * Valid
  * Fallacy
  * Tautology
* The following are the rules of inference taught by our professor:
  * Modus Ponens
  * Modus Tollens
  * Hypothetical Syllogism
  * Disjunctive Syllogism
  * Addition
  * Simplification
  * Conjunction
  * Resolution
  
####Weekly Reflection
* It was hard for me to understand the rules of inference. 
* I was confused in choosing what rule to use in solving a problem.

#WEEK 3
####Methods of Proof
* This week, I learned all about the different methods of proof and the steps in solving them.
  * Direct Proof
  * Proof by Contraposition
  * Vacuous and Trivial Proof
  * Proof by Contradiction
  * Proof by Equivalence
* Our professor also taught us the difference between contradiction and contraposition which is a common mistake committed by students

####Weekly Reflection
* I really had a hard time understanding the different methods of proof and answering the exercises.
* So far, I consider Direct Proof the easiest to use among all the methods. 

#WEEK 4
####Mathematical Induction
* Our topic for this week is Mathematical Induction.
* There are two steps involved in Mathematical Induction
  1. Basis Step
    * P(1) is shown to be true.
  2. Inductive Step
    * Assume P(k) to be true then show P(k+1) is true
    * Through this we can prove that the statement is true for all values.

####Weekly Reflection
* This topic is really easy for me because I also learned about this in our ENGALG2 subject.

#WEEK 5
####Recursive/Inductive Definition
* I learned all about Recursive Algorithms
* There are two steps in solving through Recursive/Inductive Definition
  1. Basis Step
   * Specify the value of the function at zero.
  2. Recursive Step
   * Give a rule for finding an integer.
 
####Recursive Algorithms
* We were also introduced to Recursive Algorithms.
* Recursive Algorithm
  - Solves a problem by reducing it to an instance of the same problem with smaller input.
* We also solved some examples on Recursive Algorithms. 
  - Recursive Algorithm for computing n!
  - Recursive Algorithm for computing a^n 
 
####Program Correctness
* This week, I also learned about program correctness/verification.
* The correctness of a program can be proved through two steps:
  1. PARTIAL CORRECTNESS: Show that the correct answer is obtained if the program terminates 
  2. Show that the program always terminates.

####Hoare Triple
* p{s}q, where s is the program segment
  - A program segment can be considered partially correct if the initial and final assertion, p and q respectively are true for the input values of s.

####Power Series
* I learned all about power series.
* The Zeno's Paradox was also introduced to us.
* We were also taught how to represent different functions as power series.

####Set Theory
* We were introduced to Sets and Set Builder Notation.
* Empty Set
  - { } or ∅
  - A set without any elements
* Subsets - A ⊆ B.
  - A ⊆ B
  - A is a subset of B if all elements of A are also elements of B
* Power Set
  - P(s) = {T|T⊆S}
  - The power set of s is the set of all subsets that can be derived from set S.
* Cardinality
  - |S|
  - Number of elements a set contains
 
#WEEK 6
####Functions
* I learned all about functions.
* I also learned that functions are also called mappings or transformations.
* We were also introduced to the difference between DOMAIN, CODOMAIN, and RANGE.

#WEEK 7
####No classes

#WEEK 8
####Algorithm
* This week, I was introduced to Algorithms.
* The topic was a little bit hard to understand but in the end, through the examples given by our professor I finally figured out how it works.
* Our professor gave different examples of algorithms.
  - Finding the maximum element algorithm
* We were also introduced to the term: Pseudocode.
  - A pseudocode uses programming language but in a simpler form.
* I also learned about the properties of an Algorithm
  1. Correctness
  2. Finiteness
  3. Generality

####Searching Algorithms
* I also learned about searchin algorithms this week.
* It is an algorithm which aims to locate an element in an ordered list
* We were introduced to two kinds of Searching Algorithms:
  1. Linear Search
  2. Binary Search

#WEEK 9
####Sorting Algorithms
* I learned about sorting algorithms for this week. 
* It is a kind of algorithm which organizes elements in increasing order.
* We were also given two examples of sorting algorithms:
  1. Bubble Sort
   - compares adjacent elements and interchanges them if they're not in order
  2. Insertion Sort
   - a simple sorting algorithm but usually not the most efficient

####Greedy Algorithm
* Used in optimization problems
* Aims to either minimize or maximize the value of some parameters. 
* We were given an example of a greedy algorithm applied in counting the minimum value of coins to be used in giving the change.

#WEEK 10
####Growth of Functions
* This week, we were introduced to topic, Growth of Functions.
* I also learned about Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta notation.
* Big O notation is used in determining the upper bound of a function
* Big Omega notation is used to get the lower bound of a function
* Big Theta notation is used in determining both the lower and upper bound of a function

####Algorithm Time Complexity
* We learned about algorithm time complexity specifically worst-case complexity.
* We also solved the worst-case complexity of a Bubble Sort.

####Division and Modulo Operator
* The division operator gives the quotient of two numbers.
* The modulo operator gives the remainder obtained when two numbers are divided.

####Cryptography
* This week, I also learned about the concept of Cryptography.
* I was also introduced to the Caesar Cipher.
  - This method was used by Julius Caesar.
  - It is executed by shifting each letter in a message three letters forward in the alphabet.

#WEEK 11
####Graph Theory
* This week, we were introduced to the concept of Graphs.
* I learned that graphs are structures that contains vertices which are interconnected through the edges.
* I also learned about the degree of a vertex. It is the number of connections a vertex has or in a simpler term, it is the nubmer of edges connected in a vertex.
* We were also introduced to the Handshaking Theorem. It is a formula to get the number of edges when the number of vertices and degrees are given. 

#####Euler Circuits and Paths
* This week, we also learned about Euler Circuits and Paths.
* We were introduced to the problem through the Konigsberg Problem.
* An Euler circuit is a simple circuit that passes through every edge present in the graph and goes back to the start without repitition.
* An Euler path, on the other hand, is a path that contains all edges but doesn't go back to the start.
* I also learned that an Euler Circuit contains vertices all with even degrees. Meanwhile, an Euler Path must always contain two vertices with odd degrees.

####Hamilton Circuits and Paths
* Hamilton Circuits and Paths were also introduced to us.
* It is more complicated than Euler Circuits and Paths.
* A Hamilton Circuit is a circuit that contains all the vertices and goes back to the starting vertix without repitition.
* A Hamilton Path is a path that passes through all the vertices without repitition.
* I also learned that if there is a pendant in a graph, then it doesn't contain a Hamilton Circuit. If it has 3 or more pendants then you can immediately conclude that it doesn't have a Hamilton Path.

####Matrices of Graphs
* We were also introduced to the adjacency matrix of a graph.
* A 1 in an adjacency matrix means that the two vertices are connected while a 0 means otherwise.

####Isomorphism in Graphs
* Two graphs are isomorphic if their vertices have the same connections even though they are not same in position. 

####Planar and Nonplanar Graphs
* I learned that Planar graphs are graphs that can be represented without edges that are crossing each other. While a Nonplanar graph is a graph that can't be represented without edges having to cross even after a lot of modifications.
* Kuratowski's Theorem
  - If a graph contains a K3,3 and K5 graph therefore it is non-planar.

#WEEK 13
####Graph Coloring
* This week, we learned all about Graph Coloring.
* It is the process of assigning a certain color to a vertex but adjacent vertices must not have the same color.
* The number of colors used in coloring a graph is called the chromatic number.
* I also learned about the Four Color Theorem. It says that a planar graph must have a chromatic number that is less than or equal to four.

####Trees
* We were also introduced to the concepts of Trees.
* A tree is an undirected graph which has vertices connected to each other representing a hierarchical structure.
* A rooted tree is a tree wherein the root vertix is specified. All the edges are directed away from this vertix. 
* An m-ary tree, on the other hand, is a tree whose internal vertices have no more thn m children.
* An ordered rooted tree is a tree that contains children that are ordered. The order is the value of the child on the left side is less than the parent's value while the right side is greater.

####Automata Theory
* It was our last day for DISMATH :( and we discussed about Grammar and Language and the Automata Theory.
* The automata theory is the study on the laws of computation.
* We also learned about a finite-state machine.
* We also learned that a vending machine is a finite-state machine.
