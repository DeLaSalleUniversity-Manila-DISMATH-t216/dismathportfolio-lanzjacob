#WEEK 1

####Orientation Day
* I was introduced to our subject Discrete Mathematics (DISMATH).
* My mind was tested through the Knights and Knaves exercise we had on our first day.
* Through that exercise, I was able to have a glimpse on what DISMATH is all about.

### Proof
* I learned all about proof, proposition, logical deduction and axiom.

### Truth
* I learned about the different kinds of truth which are:
  * Legal Truth
  * Authorative Truth
  * Scientific Truth
  * Probable Truth
  * Philosophical Truth

### Logical Connectives
* I was introduced to the following Logical Connectives:
  * Negation
  * Conjunction 
  * Disjunction
  * Exclusive or
  * Conditional
  * Biconditional
* I also learned about the truth tables of the different logical connectives
  * A truth table is a tool that can be used in order to know the corresponding output from all the possible combinations of the input.
  
####Logical Equivalences
* I learned about the different logical equivalences that can be used in proving.
  * Identity Laws
  * Domination Laws
  * Negation Laws
  * Double Negation Laws
  * Idempotent Law
  * Commutative Laws
  * Associative Laws
  * Distributive Laws
  * De Morgan's Laws
  * Absorption Laws

####Weekly Reflection
* At first, I thought that I will have a hard time in this subject because I didn't fully understand the topics. But after our professor explained everything, I was relieved because some of the topics were really easy.
* For me, logical equivalences is so far the easiest topic in this subject.

#WEEK 2

####Predicate Logic
* I learned that a Predicate Logic is not only concerned with logical relations between sentences or propositions as a whole, but also with their internal structure in terms of subject and predicate.

####Quantifiers
* I was introduced to the concept of quantifiers.
* I also learned about two kinds of quantifiers which are:
  * Universal Quantifier - a property is true for all values
  * Existential Quantifier - a property is true for at least one value in the domain

####Rules of Inference
* I was introduced to the important terminologies used in studying rules of inference
  * Argument
  * Valid
  * Fallacy
  * Tautology
* The following are the rules of inference taught by our professor:
  * Modus Ponens
  * Modus Tollens
  * Hypothetical Syllogism
  * Disjunctive Syllogism
  * Addition
  * Simplification
  * Conjunction
  * Resolution
  
####Weekly Reflection
* It was hard for me to understand the rules of inference. 
* I was confused in choosing what rule to use in solving a problem.

#WEEK 3
####Methods of Proof
* This week, I learned all about the different methods of proof and the steps in solving them.
  * Direct Proof
  * Proof by Contraposition
  * Vacuous and Trivial Proof
  * Proof by Contradiction
  * Proof by Equivalence
* Our professor also taught us the difference between contradiction and contraposition which is a common mistake committed by students

####Weekly Reflection
* I really had a hard time understanding the different methods of proof and answering the exercises.
* So far, I consider Direct Proof the easiest to use among all the methods. 

#WEEK 4
####Mathematical Induction
* Our topic for this week is Mathematical Induction.
* There are two steps involved in Mathematical Induction
  1. Basis Step
    * P(1) is shown to be true.
  2. Inductive Step
    * Assume P(k) to be true then show P(k+1) is true
    * Through this we can prove that the statement is true for all values.

####Weekly Reflection
* This topic is really easy for me because I also learned about this in our ENGALG2 subject.
