#WEEK 1

####Orientation Day
* I was introduced to our subject Discrete Mathematics (DISMATH).
* My mind was tested through the Knights and Knaves exercise we had on our first day.
* Through that exercise, I was able to have a glimpse on what DISMATH is all about.

### Proof
* I learned all about proof, proposition, logical deduction and axiom.

### Truth
* I learned about the different kinds of truth which are:
  * Legal Truth
  * Authorative Truth
  * Scientific Truth
  * Probable Truth
  * Philosophical Truth

### Logical Connectives
* I was introduced to the following Logical Connectives:
  * Negation
  * Conjunction 
  * Disjunction
  * Exclusive or
  * Conditional
  * Biconditional
* I also learned about the truth tables of the different logical connectives
  * A truth table is a tool that can be used in order to know the corresponding output from all the possible combinations of the input.
  
####Logical Equivalences
* I learned about the different logical equivalences that can be used in proving.
  * Identity Laws
  * Domination Laws
  * Negation Laws
  * Double Negation Laws
  * Idempotent Law
  * Commutative Laws
  * Associative Laws
  * Distributive Laws
  * De Morgan's Laws
  * Absorption Laws

####Weekly Reflection
* At first, I thought that I will have a hard time in this subject because I didn't fully understand the topics. But after our professor explained everything, I was relieved because some of the topics were really easy.
* For me, logical equivalences is so far the easiest topic in this subject.

#WEEK 2

####Predicate Logic
* I learned that a Predicate Logic is not only concerned with logical relations between sentences or propositions as a whole, but also with their internal structure in terms of subject and predicate.

####Quantifiers
* I was introduced to the concept of quantifiers.
* I also learned about two kinds of quantifiers which are:
  * Universal Quantifier - a property is true for all values
  * Existential Quantifier - a property is true for at least one value in the domain

####Rules of Inference
* I was introduced to the important terminologies used in studying rules of inference
  * Argument
  * Valid
  * Fallacy
  * Tautology
* The following are the rules of inference taught by our professor:
  * Modus Ponens
  * Modus Tollens
  * Hypothetical Syllogism
  * Disjunctive Syllogism
  * Addition
  * Simplification
  * Conjunction
  * Resolution
  
####Weekly Reflection
* It was hard for me to understand the rules of inference. 
* I was confused in choosing what rule to use in solving a problem.

#WEEK 3
####Methods of Proof
* This week, I learned all about the different methods of proof and the steps in solving them.
  * Direct Proof
  * Proof by Contraposition
  * Vacuous and Trivial Proof
  * Proof by Contradiction
  * Proof by Equivalence
* Our professor also taught us the difference between contradiction and contraposition which is a common mistake committed by students

####Weekly Reflection
* I really had a hard time understanding the different methods of proof and answering the exercises.
* So far, I consider Direct Proof the easiest to use among all the methods. 

#WEEK 4
####Mathematical Induction
* Our topic for this week is Mathematical Induction.
* There are two steps involved in Mathematical Induction
  1. Basis Step
    * P(1) is shown to be true.
  2. Inductive Step
    * Assume P(k) to be true then show P(k+1) is true
    * Through this we can prove that the statement is true for all values.

####Weekly Reflection
* This topic is really easy for me because I also learned about this in our ENGALG2 subject.

#WEEK 5
####Recursive/Inductive Definition
* I learned all about Recursive Algorithms
* There are two steps in solving through Recursive/Inductive Definition
  1. Basis Step
   * Specify the value of the function at zero.
  2. Recursive Step
   * Give a rule for finding an integer.
 
####Recursive Algorithms
* We were also introduced to Recursive Algorithms.
* Recursive Algorithm
  - Solves a problem by reducing it to an instance of the same problem with smaller input.
* We also solved some examples on Recursive Algorithms. 
  - Recursive Algorithm for computing n!
  - Recursive Algorithm for computing a^n 
 
####Program Correctness
* This week, I also learned about program correctness/verification.
* The correctness of a program can be proved through two steps:
  1. PARTIAL CORRECTNESS: Show that the correct answer is obtained if the program terminates 
  2. Show that the program always terminates.

####Hoare Triple
* p{s}q, where s is the program segment
  - A program segment can be considered partially correct if the initial and final assertion, p and q respectively are true for the input values of s.

####Power Series
* I learned all about power series.
* The Zeno's Paradox was also introduced to us.
* We were also taught how to represent different functions as power series.

####Set Theory
* We were introduced to Sets and Set Builder Notation.
* Empty Set
  - { } or ∅
  - A set without any elements
* Subsets - A ⊆ B.
  - A ⊆ B
  - A is a subset of B if all elements of A are also elements of B
* Power Set
  - P(s) = {T|T⊆S}
  - The power set of s is the set of all subsets that can be derived from set S.
* Cardinality
  - |S|
  - Number of elements a set contains
 
#WEEK 6
####Functions
* I learned all about functions.
* I also learned that functions are also called mappings or transformations.
* We were also introduced to the difference between DOMAIN, CODOMAIN, and RANGE.

#WEEK 7
####No classes! :smile:

#WEEK 8
####Algorithm
* This week, I was introduced to Algorithms.
* The topic was a little bit hard to understand but in the end, through the examples given by our professor I finally figured out how it works.
* Our professor gave different examples of algorithms.
  - Finding the maximum element algorithm
* We were also introduced to the term: Pseudocode.
  - A pseudocode uses programming language but in a simpler form.
* I also learned about the properties of an Algorithm
  1. Correctness
  2. Finiteness
  3. Generality

####Searching Algorithms
* I also learned about searchin algorithms this week.
* It is an algorithm which aims to locate an element in an ordered list
* We were introduced to two kinds of Searching Algorithms:
  1. Linear Search
  2. Binary Search

#WEEK 9
####Sorting Algorithms
* I learned about sorting algorithms for this week. 
* It is a kind of algorithm which organizes elements in increasing order.
* We were also given two examples of sorting algorithms:
  1. Bubble Sort
   - compares adjacent elements and interchanges them if they're not in order
  2. Insertion Sort
   - a simple sorting algorithm but usually not the most efficient

####Greedy Algorithm
* Used in optimization problems
* Aims to either minimize or maximize the value of some parameters. 
* We were given an example of a greedy algorithm applied in counting the minimum value of coins to be used in giving the change.

#WEEK 10
####Growth of Functions
* This week, we were introduced to topic, Growth of Functions.
* I also learned about Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta notation.
* Big O notation is used in determining the upper bound of a function
* Big Omega notation is used to get the lower bound of a function
* Big Theta notation is used in determining both the lower and upper bound of a function

####Algorithm Time Complexity
* We learned about algorithm time complexity specifically worst-case complexity.
* We also solved the worst-case complexity of a Bubble Sort.

####Division and Modulo Operator
* The division operator gives the quotient of two numbers.
* The modulo operator gives the remainder obtained when two numbers are divided.

####Cryptography
* This week, I also learned about the concept of Cryptography.
* I was also introduced to the Caesar Cipher.
  - This method was used by Julius Caesar.
  - It is executed by shifting each letter in a message three letters forward in the alphabet.
